# MovieReviews


This is my first attempt at building a machine learning model using scikit-learn in Python. <br>
Using movie review data from IMDB, I try to predict whether a review is positive or negative.<br> 
For this I use different models for this text classification problem, and use the term frequency - inverse document frequency method to turn text into numerical vectors.<br>
Then I find the accuracies of each model and optimize the best one.<br>

I follow along with a guide from <b>Towards Data Science</b> which you can find here: https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-text-classification-with-scikit-learn-632357e16f3a
